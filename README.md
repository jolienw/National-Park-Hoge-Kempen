# National-Park-Hoge-Kempen
As part of a PhD project on the spatial distribution of wild boar in National Park Hoge Kempen by means of camera traps, several environmental variables were collected during fieldwork. This repository contains both code and data for exploring the structure of NPHK and the distribution of camera traps with regard to these variables.
